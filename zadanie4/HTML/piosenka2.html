            <div class="tekst"><p>When I look into your eyes
							<p>I can see a love restrained
							<p>But darlin' when I hold you
							<p>Don't you know I feel the same</p>
							<br>
							<p>Nothin' lasts forever
							<p>And we both know hearts can change
							<p>And it's hard to hold a candle
							<p>In the cold November rain</p>
							<br>
							<p>We've been through this such a long long time
							<p>Just tryin' to kill the pain, oo yeah
							<p>But love is always coming and love is always going
							<p>And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
							<p>Walking away</p>
							<br>
							<p>If we could take the time
							<p>To lay it on the line
							<p>I could rest my head
							<p>Just knowin' that you were mine
							<p>All mine
							<p>So if you want to love me
							<p>Then darlin' don't refrain
							<p>Or I'll just end up walkin'
							<p>In the cold November rain</p>
							<br>
							<p>Do you need some time on your own
							<p>Do you need some time all alone
							<p>Everybody needs some time
							<p>On their own
							<p>Don't you know you need some time all alone
							<p>I know it's hard to keep an open heart
							<p>When even friends seem out to harm you
							<p>But if you could heal a broken heart
							<p>Wouldn't time be out to charm you</p>
							<br>
							<p>Sometimes I need some time
							<p>On my own
							<p>Sometimes I need some time all alone
							<p>Everybody needs some time
							<p>On their own
							<p>Don't you know you need some time all alone</p>
							<br>
							<p>And when your fears subside
							<p>And shadows still remain, oh yeah
							<p>I know that you can love me
							<p>When there's no one left to blame
							<p>So never mind the darkness
							<p>We still can find a way
							<p>'Cause nothin' lasts forever
							<p>Even cold November rain</p>
							<br>
							<p>Don't ya think that you need somebody
							<p>Don't ya think that you need someone
							<p>Everybody needs somebody
							<p>You're not the only one
							<p>You're not the only one</p>
							<br>
							<p>Don't ya think that you need somebody
							<p>Don't ya think that you need someone
							<p>Everybody needs somebody
							<p>You're not the only one
							<p>You're not the only one</p>
							<br>
							<p>Don't ya think that you need somebody
							<p>Don't ya think that you need someone
							<p>Everybody needs somebody
							<p>You're not the only one
							<p>You're not the only one</p>
							<br>
							<p>Don't ya think that you need somebody
							<p>Don't ya think that you need someone
							<p>Everybody needs somebody
